# [IBM BlueHack Project](https://apertus-colloquium.mybluemix.net/)
## Apertus Colloquium - "Open Dialog" 
This is a project I have had the pleasure to work on with a great group of people. This is our **Immigration ChatBot** This ChatBot serves to give prospective U.S. a platform to easily navigate the U.S. Immigration process. It enables users enter information and determine eligibility and also answer questions about the overall application process. Ultimatley, this application can be scaled do provide applications such as form-filling, document conversion and analysis and helpful Q&A.

## Background
This project was a developed during the 2017 IBM BlueHack at IBM Mass Lab in Littleton, MA. My team members and I were a part of the Software Developer Internship program for IBM, working on various teams within the IBM ecosystem. Specifically, I was a member of the Watson Conversation Service team as a Backend Software Developer.
